# TODO

## Known Issues

- [x] YAML commenting doesn't work correctly!

- [x] Update VDocs on every change, not just trigger events

- [ ] Request Forwarding for Intellisense!

- [x] Script tags should be treated as svelte source

- [ ] Nested tags without spacing don't highlight correctly

- [ ] Still unsure which handler handles each case

- [ ] Check line-ending handling

- [x] Code blocks should always be Markdown

```bash
this is a code block
```
